However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

ABOUT US: *
The demand for home renovations has never been stronger, yet, it's surprisingly difficult for a new homeowner to renovate. It can take a decade to build up enough home equity and savings to pay for a major renovation. As a result, recent homeowners do a lot of financially-suboptimal things to compensate like borrow from their 401k, rack up credit card debt, and use high-interest personal loans. Or they just live unhappily for years in a home that doesn't meet their family's needs.
But by completing a major renovation, homeowners are increasing the value of their home. Professional real estate investors leverage this After Renovation Value (ARV) to roll the increase in value into new properties all the time. But there hasn't been a great way for homeowners to take advantage of this. If homeowners had an ability to borrow against the ARV, they could increase their borrowing power up to 10x.
To meet this need, RenoFi created a platform that enables homeowners to borrow funds from RenoFi approved lenders in the form of the first home equity loan purpose-built for renovations! Unlike standard home equity loans, RenoFi Loans use the value of your home post-renovation which lets you borrow the most money at the best possible terms. RenoFi is creating a full suite of renovation loan products to better suit the needs of today’s homeowners!
For homeowners, RenoFi makes it possible to renovate years earlier than might be otherwise feasible. For contractors, we empower the financing of renovations at the point of sale, reducing instances of scope reduction, and ensuring prompt payment. Our lender partners, most often credit unions, rely on RenoFi's platform to generate loans, create efficiencies, and grow membership. The lenders pay RenoFi for the new loans, which allows us to offer our services to homeowners for free. RenoFi is truly a win-win-win for everyone involved.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.
Job Description
Square is growing its financial services footprint through the launch of new products and international expansions. This is an exciting time for our business and we are looking for a Data Scientist to join our Finance and Strategy Banking team to lead analytical and strategic projects for our banking business.
This position will be fundamental in shaping our product strategy and communicating critical decisions to Product leadership, our Bank partners and to Block management. Success in this role requires the ability to exercise excellent business acumen while often operating autonomously without existing problem solving frameworks or precedent solutions. We are thus looking for someone with a strong analytical background who can manage and drive solutions across a variety of strategic and financially focused challenges.
As a Data Scientist, you will be embedded within the Square Banking Finance & Strategy team, leveraging data analytics, statistics, and predictive modeling techniques to empower data-driven decision making across our growing suite of financial products offered to Square sellers. In this role, you will collaborate closely with Business Intelligence, Finance, Product Management, Marketing and other cross-functional team members to drive recommendations that influence the direction of our Square Banking business.
Candidates can sit in any Square office in the US or be remote from any US state with the exception of Alaska.
You Will:
Apply a diverse set of tactics such as statistics, quantitative reasoning, and machine learning to analyze key performance indicators
Partner with senior leaders and partners to surface analytical trends that influence business decisions across our credit and banking products
Develop data driven models to forecast the performance and growth of our products
Provide comprehensive analytics, develop tools and resources to empower data access and self-service to partner teams
Collaborate across Marketing, Capital Markets, and Business Intelligence (among other teams) to identify and understand complex relationships between key drivers of our business
Qualifications
You Have:
5+ years of analytics experience and a Bachelor's degree or equivalent
Fluency in SQL and familiar with a scripting language like Python
Experience exploring and understanding complex datasets and data systems, leveraging statistical and machine-learning techniques to solve practical business problems such as hypothesis testing, cross-selling, clustering user archetypes, and predicting churn
Experience working with technical and non-technical partners, such as product managers and product marketing managers, on product development and growth initiatives
Strong communication skills: ability to clearly communicate complex results to technical and non-technical audiences in verbal, visual, and written media
Demonstrated exceptional achievement in a fast-paced, cross-functional environment
Commitment to Square's purpose of Economic Empowerment
[Bonus] An advanced degree (M.S., PhD.) in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Physical Sciences, Economics, or a related technical field
[Bonus] Background with banking products, such as loans or credit/debit cards

About Peek
1.1 billion people worldwide have preventable or curable vision loss, including 43 million who are blind. And rates are rising. Vision loss can have devastating effects on education, social status, and livelihoods. Simple, cost-effective treatments exist, like cataract operations or glasses. Further, the burden of most eye conditions is not borne equally. The majority of cases are in Africa and Asia, where eye care services are limited and people travel long distances to reach hospitals.
Peek Vision is a social enterprise that powers eye health programme providers to strengthen systems and service delivery with a software and data intelligence platform.
We are dynamic, impact-driven and award-winning . Our solutions for school & community eye health providers include:
1. Population-level eye health surveys

Our financial technology creates more valuable, efficient properties by turning unpredictable loss and damage into dependable operating income, getting each lease closer to zero balance.
Powered by our data platform and AI risk engine, LeaseLock develops solutions, like our flagship lease insurance, that are driving the future of residential rental real estate. Launched in 2016 and growing rapidly, we’ve insured over $3 billion in leases with clients representing the top property management companies and ownership groups in the country.

It’s like an always-on dinner party. We believe that good friendships are the foundation of everything, and we built Clubhouse to make it easier to fill your life with them.

We launched in 2020 and have grown quickly in the time since. Each day, millions of people are now exploring the hallways of Clubhouse, creating rooms about every topic imaginable.

We take pride in being a small and productive team, with a relentless focus on our product and the community. As a company we are well funded, with backing from a16z and dozens of the best angel investors in the world, providing us with years of runway. We love what we do and have a lot of work ahead of us. So if you’re a talented builder, come join the club!

The Role

As a Product Data Scientist, you will work closely with our product and engineering teams to formulate and answer key questions about our product. You will play a central role in collecting, modeling, and analyzing data, and will drive meaningful changes to our product and user experiences based on your findings.

In this role, you will report to our Head of Data Science. We are a remote friendly-company — with our headquarters in San Francisco and a strong commitment to ensuring people can do great work here and thrive without having to live near an office. This role is open to candidates across the U.S.

Who you are

You are curious, inquisitive, and enjoy solving ambiguous, open-ended problems. You are able to identify high impact problem areas with little direction. You have a healthy skepticism about data and know when to dig deeper into a problem.

You have the technical skills to work independently. You are comfortable with advanced modeling and statistical techniques and are highly fluent in SQL and Python. You have deep experience with experiment design and analysis. You have experience as a data scientist at a fast growing company and have a proven record of impact.

You are a strong communicator and are able to explain complex concepts to a wide audience. You are adept at crafting clear and impactful data visualizations.

You are meticulous and forthright. You are experienced with finding clear answers despite messy data sets, and are able to catch data issues as they arise.

You bias towards action. You like to build and ship - favoring practical choices, speed and a respect for sequencing. You focus on the things that matter and push back on things that don’t. You make deadlines for yourself and you move fast.

You’re scrappy and entrepreneurial. You thrive in fast-paced environments and are comfortable with not knowing the answer to something. You are willing to roll up your sleeves no matter what the challenge is.

You take pride in what you do. You care deeply about your work. You read through details and think about every bit of the user experience. If something seems off, you come up with a good solution and fix it without being asked to do so. You’re proactive with suggestions and people know they can count on you to get things done.

You enjoy your work. You love what you do, not because you feel you have to, but because you’re so excited to create something big for the world. Your favorite thing to do is to take on a huge challenge and pull it off.

You care about doing the right thing. You value diversity and go out of your way to ensure others feel welcome. You enjoy hanging out with your teammates, have a low-ego, and make the workplace more fun for everyone.

What you will do

In this role, you will play a key part in defining the data culture within Clubhouse and ensure that we have principled, data-driven decision-making processes. As part of the early data team, you will work on numerous zero-to-one projects and will have a direct impact on our product direction. You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside our product and engineering teams on high-profile feature launches that affect millions of people.

There are numerous complex product questions that we would look to a data partner to help the team untangle. On a given day, you may be performing and sharing complex analyses that inform a wide variety of decisions. Or you may be playing a hands-on role in new feature launches, ensuring that we understand the impact of policy changes on users and can identify potential issues early in the process. You will have the opportunity to do foundational analysis on important, unsolved questions across a wide range of problem spaces.

You’ll grow and improve rapidly. At Clubhouse you’ll be working with an incredible team, who love to learn from and teach each other. You’ll find yourself stretching to new areas, immersed in feedback, challenged by your teammates, and growing your skills on a daily basis.

You’ll shape the product strategy. You will get to use your own product (and talk with others while they are using it) every day, and have significant input into its development. Your ideas will always be heard. Your work will vary over time and will cover a variety of areas. On a given day, you may be launching a new way of ranking support tickets, analyzing trends in different types of user behavior, or finding ways to proactively identify content in violation of our policies.

You’ll be an owner. We believe in hiring people and giving them as much responsibility as they can handle.

You’ll create something meaningful. Social products allow people to connect in ways that were never before possible. When the telephone was invented, it suddenly allowed people to speak with others across the world. Thanks to FaceTime, grandparents everywhere can now watch their grandchildren grow up. At Clubhouse, you’ll be figuring out something entirely new for the world—a positive product that brings people’s voices together for deep and meaningful conversations, creates new relationships, builds empathy across cultures, entertains people, and helps people develop ideas that change the course of their lives.
This position is fully remote, and includes competitive base pay, a comprehensive health benefits package, company equity, 401k, plus additional benefits and stipends. The salary for this position is between $171,000 and $215,000. It may vary based on the applicant’s level of experience, education, specialized knowledge, skills, and the market rate for similar positions. The salary range is subject to change and may be modified in the future.

As an early team member at Clubhouse you will be a critical voice and have significant influence over the direction of the company. We will compensate you well, invest deeply in your development, and ensure this is the single best work experience of your life.

Our users come from all walks of life, and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds. Our company is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.

Machine Learning Research Assistant,Modern Intelligence,"Remote in Austin, TX",NaN,PostedPosted 5 days ago,"$7,000 a month","Whereas the current trend in machine learning is towards more data, more GPUs, and models with trillions of parameters, the fruit fly brain needs less than 200…",/rc/clk?jk=b97ac176c799ad23&fccid=6a2935a9ce526df2&vjs=3,"Modern Intelligence is seeking exceptional students to join the team as a Machine Learning Research Assistant, and contribute to the creation of classical and hierarchical neural networks for American defense, in areas including sensor fusion, decision making, autonomy, complex inference, electronic warfare, and more. This position is the candidate’s choice of half-time or full-time. Interested candidates with a PhD are encouraged to apply to our AI Research Scientist Internship position. This position is open to remote candidates.


About Modern’s Research:
Modern Intelligence is an Artificial Intelligence product and R&D company. Our product line is defense-first, and tackles some of the hardest and most interesting problems of the decade in machine learning, with a current focus on multi-modal domain awareness and complex scene understanding. And our research program focuses on foundational improvements to machine learning that aim to close the performance gap between artificial and biological neural networks. Whereas the current trend in machine learning is towards more data, more GPUs, and models with trillions of parameters, the fruit fly brain needs less than 200,000 neurons to achieve vision, target identification, navigation, and obstacle avoidance that is orders of magnitude more robust than any artificial neural network.

The brittleness and inefficiency of artificial neural networks likely comes from a combination of
artificial neurons having “less compute”,
artificial neural architectures produced by NAS and human engineers having suboptimal topologies, and
SGD and other training processes being highly inefficient

relative to their biological equivalents. Modern’s research program uses proprietary advances in information theory to train hierarchical neural networks, or HNNs, with modular intermediate levels of structure that address the problem of multiscale competence. (See a recent interview with Dr. Michael Levin [video][transcript] to learn more about the high-level biological insights that motivate multiscale competence as a desirable [and possibly necessary] factor for robustness and efficient learning of high-complexity problems.)

About the position:
Pay: $3,500 / month for half-time or $7,000 / month for full-time

We’re looking for a curious and insightful student who believes that the answer isn’t just more data, and who has a deep appreciation of the benefits of sparsity, hierarchy, efficiency, and taking the right lessons from biology. With your team at Modern, you’ll get hands-on experience with some of the hardest problems in ML from both the product and the research direction. You’ll help build Modern’s research community, and will contribute directly to a research program that creates and trains HNNs in order to address the multiscale competence problem, work towards natural robustness in neural networks, and create general re-usable neural modules that can be leveraged in future learning. You’ll have as much guidance as you need and as much project ownership as you want, including the opportunity and encouragement to propose, design, and run your own experiments, and to publish the results.
Basic Qualifications:
Recent PhD or active enrollment in a PhD program in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or related field. Undergraduates and masters students will be considered if their application is sufficiently strong.
Strong proficiency in coding and data science
Competence, and ideally proficiency, in at least one popular ML framework, e.g. Tensorflow or Pytorch.

We are building the best place for reading and writing on the internet—a place where today’s smartest writers, thinkers, experts, and storytellers can share big, interesting ideas; a place where ideas are judged on the value they provide to readers, not the fleeting attention they can attract for advertisers.

We are looking for a Senior Data Scientist who will help us build a new future for the written word on the web as part of a team that translates data into actionable insights.

Day to day, you will:
Be a strategic partner to a diverse range of stakeholders in editorial, engineering, marketing, and product management, generating data-driven insights to influence the direction of our product roadmap and critical operating decisions.

Experience with stakeholder management; effectively driving shared priorities and persuading through storytelling with data
Strong Python skills at running data analytics using Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and the Python ecosystem

Balto is a software that coaches sales and customer service agents to improve their phone calls live while they’re on the phone with the customer. Powered by artificial intelligence, Balto listens to both sides of the conversation and visually prompts these agents with the best things to say, live on every call.
Pretty cool, right? But how does Balto's AI know how to help the agents? How can a software program possibly understand every situation discussed across the millions of phone calls where it is used?
That’s where you come in.
In order for the AI to be able to make the best predictions and recommendations in the moment, it needs to be trained on accurate, reliable data. Our data labelers play the vital role of listening to call snippets and ensuring that the information on each call is being transcribed correctly.
Your responsibility and high attention to detail will serve you well as you quickly listen to snippets, check what you are hearing against the generated transcription, and make any necessary changes to ensure the submitted transcription correctly matches what is being said on the call.
This is a highly independent and flexible role; you are welcome to work whenever and wherever best suits you. The only requirement is that you commit at least 20 hours a week to the role.
Sounds great, how do I get paid?
Labelers are paid 80 cents for each minute of audio they transcribe. On average, it takes two seconds to label one second of audio, and your speed will only increase with experience. So the faster you can label accurately, the more money you can make. Labelers tend to make $450-$650 per week depending on their speed.
If you are fluent in English, responsible and detail-oriented, eligible to work in the United States, and interested in getting paid to improve and empower an innovative AI machine, this role might be for you!
Requirements:
Fluent in English
Minimum 20 hours commitment/week
Eligible to work in the US
Prior experience in audio transcription is preferred
Responsible & detail-oriented
INTERVIEW PROCESS:
After we receive your application, we'll review it. If there's alignment, you'll be sent a brief skills test via email asking you to label some audio segments to show you what the role will be like.
We expect the test to take 10 minutes or less.
If you pass, you'll receive a 15 min phone call from a Balto team member to tell you a bit more about the role and to answer any questions you have. if all goes well, we'll move forward with an offer which will include the completion of a background check."

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Senior Data Scientist,Omada Health,"Remote in San Francisco, CA",3.6,PostedPosted 30+ days ago,NaN,"Working with over 1,700+ customers — including health plans, health systems, and employers ranging in size from small businesses to Fortune 500s across a wide…",/rc/clk?jk=d51427de90fbee90&fccid=405e429c66f5d7ea&vjs=3,"Omada Health is on a mission to inspire and engage people in lifelong health, one step at a time.
Job Overview:
We're all familiar with the problem. The convoluted incentives of the US healthcare system have yielded ballooning costs in exchange for low life expectancies relative to other wealthy countries. Omada has spent the last eleven years pioneering a value-based healthcare system for chronic conditions to correct this trend by tying revenue to proximal gauges of clinical outcomes. With our incentives in order, we leverage data to empower our care team of health coaches and clinical specialists to coordinate the most effective behavior change strategy for each member of our digital programs.
The Omada Insights Lab exists at the heart of this endeavor by focusing on two key areas of research:
Measuring Healthy Behaviors: Developing and validating innovative measurements of health outcomes to orient internal decisions and to refocus the collective conversation of the digital health industry around metrics that matter.
Coordinating Personalized Care: Sifting through a rich dataset of natural language, readings from connected devices like blood glucose monitors, demographics, and so forth to tailor effective interventions that fit members' unique circumstances.
As a Senior Data Scientist, you will collaborate with colleagues from a diversity of quantitative, product, operational, and clinical backgrounds to conduct research related to the focus areas of the Insights Lab. For example:
Causal Inference: Detect the incremental value produced by the volume and character of the time our care team spends with members
Natural language processing: Quantify abstract concepts such as rapport and emotional convergence in the dialogue between a member and their coach
Recommendation: Optimize Omada's impact on the collective health of the population by matching each member to their ideal coach
Your work will change the lives of our members, enrich the jobs of Omada's care team, and, if we play our cards right, make the US healthcare system just a little bit better.
About You:
Deep expertise in statistical methods such as experimental design, regression, causal inference with observational data, time series modeling, and multilevel modeling
Ability to synthesize and incorporate scientific and academic research into analytical approach
Confidence in Python, R, or another analytical scripting language
Some experience with SQL is a plus
Degree in a quantitative field such as statistics, economics, applied math, operations research, engineering, or relevant work experience
5 years of applicable industry experience in a quantitative field, especially in health economics or digital health
A strong desire for impact and a bias for action despite ambiguity. We believe in learning by doing!
You enjoy storytelling and relish teaching and learning from your peers
Open to traveling once a month to SF headquarters to collaborate with the team
Benefits:

Competitive salary with generous annual cash bonus
Stock options
Remote first work from home culture
Flexible vacation to help you rest, recharge, and connect with loved ones
Generous parental leave
Health, dental, and vision insurance (and above market employer contributions)
401k retirement savings plan
Work from Home stipend
Monthly mental wellness days
Two giftable Omada enrollments per calendar year
...and more!
It takes a village to change health care. As we build together toward our mission, we strive to embody the following values in our day-to-day work. We hope these hold meaning for you as well as you consider Omada!
Start with Trust. We listen closely and we operate with kindness. We provide respectful and candid feedback to each other.
Seek Context. We ask to understand and we build connections. We do our research up front to move faster down the road.
Act Boldly. We innovate daily to solve problems, improve processes, and find new opportunities for our members and customers.
Deliver Results. We reward impact above output. We set a high bar, we're not afraid to fail, and we take pride in our work.
Succeed Together. We prioritize Omada's progress above team or individual. We have fun as we get stuff done, and we celebrate together.
Remember Why We're Here. We push through the challenges of changing health care because we know the destination is worth it.

Are you a self-starter who is comfortable with ambiguity and wants to tackle challenging engineering problems? Do you want to work with a world-class remote team while having a big impact on the machine-learning approach for an early-stage project?
We are looking for a Data Scientist who is interested in working with us at AE Studio on the future of neurotechnology!
About AE Studio
AE Studio is a mid-sized startup from California. We have a team of highly skilled developers, designers, and data scientists building products that increase human agency. We use the most recent technologies to develop solutions for startups as well as large companies like Samsung and Berkshire Hathaway. We have an awesome work environment and a highly productive process.
One of AE Studio’s core missions is to develop brain-computer interface technologies that increase human agency. We are looking for someone with experience in data engineering, strong problem-solving skills, self-management skills, and enthusiasm to learn more about the intersection of data science and neuroscience.
About the Role
You will work on building deep learning models for neural decoding (classification or regression models with neurodata input). You will first learn the details of a variety of brain recording technologies (experience with multimodal brain recordings is a plus!), and help discover what type of model architectures work consistently across data types and decoding tasks (experience with transfer learning is a plus!). You will collaborate with our international BCI team, in addition to outside academic and industry organizations, in a semi-autonomous research role as we work together to develop an operating system for BCI applications.
You:
Have a master’s degree (or equivalent) in a relevant field (e.g. neuroscience, electrical engineering, physics, or mathematics)
Are fluent with Python and experienced with Jupyter notebooks
Have experience in at least one of the following: neuroscience, BCI experimentation and neural signal processing
Have experience with working with deep learning libraries such as tensorflow or pytorch
Please include a link to your public code repository (e.g. GitHub) in your application
Bonus Points For:
A PhD (or equivalent) in a relevant field (e.g. neuroscience, electrical engineering, physics, or mathematics)
Experience with Python software development and/or data engineering
Experience using AWS infrastructure (EC2, S3, databases, IAM, etc)
Experience with real-time systems
What do you get out of it??
Opportunity to work on world-changing technology
Collaborative & friendly remote work environment (we're all nice )
Good pay
Reasonable & flexible work hours
Yearly retreat bringing together our teams from across the world
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Equity
Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.
At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.
Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.
We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.
Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.

Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in the United States. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We launched Pearl Health because we believe primary care providers, armed with the proper tools and resources, can have an outsized impact in achieving high-quality, affordable healthcare. We foresee a shift to an increasingly value-based future where physicians and provider groups will participate in the value they create for the healthcare system and will increasingly require proper tooling, information systems, capital support, and technology to succeed in these models.
We are a team of physicians (Groups), practice-enablement experts (VillageMD, Steward, Stellar), technologists (athenahealth, TrialSpark, Flatiron Health) and health plan leaders (Oscar, Clover, Centivo) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to America's future health. Today, we support over 100 providers in value-based Medicare models and are on track to substantially increase the Medicare population we will be responsible for managing with our physician partners for 2023 (+$300M of Medicare benchmark risk). Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz and AlleyCorp.
What we hope you can do...
We are seeking a brilliant Data Scientist with a track record of propelling business strategies through analytical insights and algorithmic systems. Your work will be a core asset of our company, allowing us to more efficiently provide better care to our members and to create novel financial arrangements for each of our aligned physicians. You should be a strategic and analytical thinker, an effective communicator, an expert in analytical and data infrastructure systems, comfortable working with actuaries on complicated risk analyses, and performing sophisticated modeling exercises independently. We anticipate that AI, ML, and NLP will be central elements of our product, so you should have a deep familiarity with and passion for these technologies.
What a Data Scientist means to us...
Translate the company's goals and vision into its strategy and operations by conducting sophisticated quantitative analyses while informing decisions about our infrastructure and approach
Help us change the future of work for doctors in America by applying state of the art technology solutions, including machine learning, natural language processing, and explicable AI - likely in partnership with key external partners.
Experience developing and deploying sophisticated algorithmic approaches to prioritizing patient care in a clinical setting (or comparably sophisticated spaces).
Support all business lines, including sales and business development, by enabling those teams to nimbly make data-driven decisions, balancing competing goals, and making difficult trade-offs when required.
Partner effectively with our Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer toward best-in-class analytics systems to give our physician partners insight into their patient panels.
Support the technology needs of various departments by creating a data-literate ecosystem.
Who you are…
8+ years of experience in performing results-driven quantitative analysis in a collaborative environment.
Degree in statistics, applied math, computer science, engineering or a related field.
SQL expertise and strong foundation in at least one of the main data science programming languages. Python is our current primary language and is preferred.
A proven ability to conduct research and empower data-driven aspects of our product through a mix of internal resources and external vendors, especially in AI, ML and NLP domains.
Experience collaborating with data engineering teams to define needs for an ETL pipeline and familiarity with the most common ETL tools.
Thoughtful collaborator, able to manage multiple demanding stakeholders, assimilate complex information quickly, and scope work in a way that balances deep insight and fast turnaround.

GiveDirectly (GD) aims to reshape international giving – and millions of lives – by providing cash grants directly to the poorest people in the world. The Brookings Institution estimates that $100B of cash transfers would be required to eliminate the poverty gap; the aid sector currently spends $135B each year, much of it on evidence-free interventions. GiveDirectly wants to change that, establishing cash transfers as a benchmark for foreign aid – as the index fund is a benchmark for the financial industry – and in the process accelerating the end of extreme poverty.
GD has raised over $800M since launching in 2011, delivered cash to more than 1 million people, and launched offices in 11 countries across North America, Africa, and the Middle East. We've also supported 19 large-scale, experimental research projects that indicate strong recipient impact of our programs – including the largest universal basic income experiment in history. We use concrete evidence to inform the design of our programs: from research results published in leading journals, to in-depth qualitative work. As a result, GD has been celebrated as one of the most innovative non-profit companies by Fast Company, while the growing cash transfer movement (and GD's leading role within it) have been featured in the New York Times Magazine, This American Life, Foreign Affairs, and The Economist.
We're looking for exceptional talent to grow our collaborative, diverse team. Joining GiveDirectly provides the opportunity to work alongside individuals who come from 21 different countries and speak 69 different languages. We're actively working toward an equitable and inclusive environment for all team members, and seek candidates who will bring diverse perspectives and experiences to our organization. We recruit from organizations across all industries: our team has hailed from sectors including start-ups, government, consultancies, investment banks, and nonprofits.
Across our global offices, our culture is candid, analytical, non-hierarchical, and fast-paced. We value ability, adaptability, and willingness to learn. We offer competitive salary and benefits, as well as performance-based bonuses.
This role is fully remote but working hours must overlap with typical working hours (9am-5pm) in the East Africa timezone by at least 4 hours a few times per week.
About the Field Data team
As we scale to reach millions of people experiencing extreme poverty, we believe that data can transform cash delivery by:
Improving recipient experience
Increasing operational efficiency
Mitigating risk
Conveying our impact to donors
To realize this vision, we are building a best-in-class data team focused on cash delivery: operations, payments, and recipient safeguarding.
You will be the Field Data team's first Data Scientist, reporting to the Senior Data Manager and working closely with the Senior Data Architect. This is an opportunity to join at the inception of the team and guide foundational decisions regarding vision, priorities, and best practices. We are a small (but growing) group with a startup mentality, applying engineering best practices and a product development approach to data.
Our data infrastructure is built on AWS and Databricks, with dashboards and visualizations in Tableau. We primarily use SQL, Python, and R.
About this role
You will deliver insights and decision making tools that help shape cash delivery by determining which projects we take on, how we design them, and how we implement them.
Responsibilities include:
Statistical analysis and predictive modeling. Own process end-to-end: implement statistical methods and build, train, and deploy predictive models to solve problems in cash delivery utilizing code (e.g., Python, R). Current priorities:
Targeting. Implement and improve existing machine learning algorithms predicting poverty level from call-detail records (CDR) and geospatial data. This work enables us to remotely identify eligible recipients at scale, and has been highlighted in WIRED with findings published by our research partners in Nature.
Risk prediction. Develop new risk prediction models that help us design programs and target recipient outreach to keep recipients and communities safe.
Support data quality assurance. Work with the Senior Data Architect to design processes that ensure key metrics, models, and analysis are built on high quality data.
Communication. Collaborate with leaders throughout the organization to define data product requirements, educate them about solutions, and make recommendations.
This role has a high degree of autonomy and the ability to shape our process from the ground up by determining best practices and informing the data product roadmap.

Reports to: Senior Manager, Data
About you

Frame a testable question from ambiguous requirements
Gather, clean, and manipulate the required data
Deliver answers that directly inform important decisions

Senior Data Scientist,"Vivante Health, Inc",Remote,NaN,PostedPosted 7 days ago,NaN,"We're looking for a solution-focused Data Scientist with substantial health data experience to join our data experimentation, analytics and ML efforts.",/rc/clk?jk=49ffc273fc14fa5a&fccid=7cada67e9dd36921&vjs=3,"Job Title: Senior Data Scientist
Remote – USA and British Columbia Only
About Vivante
Vivante Health is an innovative startup reinventing the way chronic conditions are managed. We’re filling the unmet needs of people with chronic conditions that are invisible, neglected or stigmatized, starting with digestive disease.
Why digestive? Because an astonishing 70 million people in the US are affected—that’s twice the number with diabetes and more than many other chronic conditions combined. Unlike other chronic conditions, though, digestive diseases often go untreated or misdiagnosed…because of stigma.
At Vivante, we think it’s time to bring digestive health to the forefront while providing REAL solutions to the millions who are struggling and don’t know where to turn. Our health management ecosystem, GIThrive, empowers people—through brilliant technology and advanced science—to spend less time worrying about their digestive symptoms and more time living life. GIThrive is the first and only employer-sponsored program for digestive health.
We’re a young company, but our collective experience in clinical care, patient education, and consumer technology is unmatched. If you have the knowledge, passion and experience to enhance our team and the idea of working for a fast-paced, sometimes chaotic startup excites you, we’d love to hear from you.
With a remote-first workforce across North America and Greece, we’re changing the way healthcare is delivered.
Position Summary
We're looking for a solution-focused Data Scientist with substantial health data experience to join our data experimentation, analytics and ML efforts. Someone with the ability to synthesize complex problems and develop programs to apply data science concepts to improve business efficiencies. If you like discovering and operationalizing insights, collaborating with other great engineers, and empowering business stakeholders to perform self-service analytics, please read on!
Our GIThrive solution works with our members (patients) to help identify and manage their digestive health conditions. A big part of this is integrating a variety of novel and industry standard data sources to build the best model of their GI health to power the best recommendations possible. We do this well for solving today's problems, but Vivante is investing in the future of health science, and that's where you would come in.g
We've recently overhauled our data warehouse, data pipelines, and analytics environments. We're busy labeling data, optimizing schemas and building models. There's good momentum here, but still plenty of decisions to be made for a well-rounded Data Scientist that wants to have their hands in all of that.
Why is this a great opportunity for a senior data scientist?
The problem domain and our approach to solving it is super compelling. We're bringing together data sources that have never been joined and discovering new GI health insights that help real people to manage and support their real medical conditions
It's still early enough that there are a lot of decisions and new discoveries to be made, so this is your chance to get in early and have a big impact on our data science program
Other things about our environment you should be aware of:
We're still a small company, which means that everyone still wears a lot of hats and we need a data scientist who's comfortable doing some of their own data engineering work. That said, our existing data science and DevOps teams have built an extremely efficient set of data pipelines based on best-in-class hosted SaaS frameworks to greatly minimize the data and AI engineering overhead burden
We're all really passionate about improving clinical outcomes for our members and truly advancing the GI health space. Most of us also have personal (direct/family/friend) connections to GI health problems. Whatever it is that fuels you, we're on a mission to build something much larger than ourselves here and looking for another partner in driving that mission forward
Responsibilities Include:
Lead and mentor data science and analytics team members
Collaborate with our clinical teams on building and operationalizing personalized patient insights
Lead data collection and mining procedures
Identify and develop metrics to tackle business problems
Define, experiment, and build predictive models that span multiple functions within the business
Support ad-hoc population health analytics to support decision making
Help further our adoption of of healthcare data standards and interoperability efforts
Partner with engineering and contribute to our data pipelines with in-depth knowledge of modern data modeling
Partner with internal teams to provide guidance on architecture, datastore selection, data modeling, and query optimization for our existing and future applications
Utilization of data visualization tools for delivering key insights to stakeholders
Stay abreast of emerging data science/AI/ML technologies to identify business opportunities
Continuously drive improvements to data quality, documentation and integrity
You'll be a good fit here if you are:
A team player. You like collaborating closely with other engineers, often through open communication, pair programming, design & code reviews
Empathetic to our members’ GI health conditions and are driven to improve their outcomes
Security oriented. We take the stewardship of our customer's healthcare data seriously, and take no shortcuts to protect it
Comfortable with a distributed workforce. We interact with each other via video chat, Slack and PR comments
A self motivated, creative problem solver
We're really proud of the team culture that we foster today, which is extremely friendly and supportive while constantly reaching to raise our own standards of engineering. We're really excited about what we're building, and usually having fun building it together. If all of that sounds fun to you too, we'd love to meet you.

Background


The UNDP Accelerator Labs Network is the largest learning network in the world. It includes 91 public innovation labs and a global curation team, all embedded within UNDP’s global architecture and country platforms.
Each lab surfaces and reinforces locally sourced solutions to development challenges, and mobilizes a wide and dynamic range of partners who contribute knowledge, resources, and experience. The goal is to transform traditional development approaches by introducing new protocols, backed by evidence and practice, to accelerate the testing and dissemination of solutions within, and across countries, while at the same time enabling the global community to collectively learn from local knowledge and ingenuity at a speed and scale that our societies and planet require.
To support these learning outcomes, the UNDP Accelerator Labs global team is building a Network Learning Strategy and Prototype for knowledge management. The strategy has a strong digital component, that builds on the idea of “going where the information is”. The goal is to facilitate the detection of “where” knowledge is held in the network, and “why” it can be assumed to be held there, rather than trying to capture, infer, or extrapolate precisely “what” that knowledge is. This requires “listening” to the activities of the network, by centralizing and making sense of the content the labs put out, as well as the digital traces they leave behind as they conduct their work.
The Network Learning Prototype pulls together these unstructured data mainly text from various sources, including conversations on WhatsApp and Teams, blogs published on UNDP Country Office websites and Medium, and internal reporting feeds. While it is hardly big data, the volume is reaching a point where automation is becoming necessary to detect latent topics and trends that emerge from the network, and to structure and map open-ended taxonomies. The NLP researcher will work on this directly with the Lead Data Scientist of the UNDP Accelerator Labs global team.
The purpose of this procurement exercise is to contract an individual consultant who will work with the lead Data Scientist of the UNDP Accelerators Labs global team on a novel knowledge management pipeline that pulls together unstructured data (mainly text) from various sources including conversations on WhatsApp and Teams, blogs published on UNDP Country Office websites and Medium, and internal reporting feeds and computationally looks for latent topics and trends that emerge from the work being conducted across the network of Accelerator Labs. The main objective of the consultancy will be to improve the topic modeling component of the pipeline.



Duties and Responsibilities


OF WORK, RESPONSIBILITIES AND DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ANALYTICAL WORK
Explore word and sequence embedding techniques to improve an early prototype for structuring open-ended, multi-language taxonomies.
Design, build, and evaluate topic models and more recent BERT-based zero-shot classifiers in Python for the Network Learning Prototype—primarily in English, but ideally also in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic.
Collaborate with different teams across UNDP to build a corpus of sustainable development-related documents, presumably in multiple languages, and fine-tune language models using this corpus.
Work with the Lead Data Scientist and the Full Stack Developer to take useful models and classifiers to production and integrate them into a suite of UNDP Accelerator Labs online tools and platforms.
Conduct occasional text analyses for the Accelerator Labs Network global team.
Document the work produced.

Our Values
Members always come first
We serve multiple stakeholders, including providers, customers, and members. Most of the time, stakeholder priorities will be in alignment. Occasionally, we encounter difficult situations where there may need to be a tradeoff. In these situations, we prioritize members–they are the reason we exist and their wellbeing is our highest priority.
Move fast to change lives
We move quickly and intentionally to minimize suffering and do right by members. We make decisions courageously and swiftly, especially when those decisions are easily reversible. Knowing that work often fills the time allotted, we hold ourselves accountable to ambitious yet realistic timelines. We use the 80/20 rule and don't let perfect be the enemy of the good.
Science will win
Spring Health embraces science at every stage of our mission, from our beginnings with proprietary research published in a world-renowned, peer-reviewed journal to our recently published
clinical and financial ROI studies. And yet science, for us, extends beyond clinical papers–it means relying on data, evidence, and validation as much as possible, versus making assumptions. Science, for us, means truly understanding the status quo so that we can meaningfully disrupt it.
Candor with care
We believe in the power of candor to promote clarity and reduce friction, confusion, and stress. We do not refrain from speaking truth–including speaking truth to power–and we aim to do so with care and positive intent. We speak up when we don't understand or agree with each other, and deliver feedback with empathy, kindness, and genuine concern for others. Even when honesty may feel uncomfortable, we are direct and transparent–but always with care.
Embrace diverse teams and perspectives
Diversity makes us stronger. Whether its differences in background, perspective, ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality, age, or religion, we go beyond just having diverse talent—we work intentionally to support and amplify diverse voices around a table.
Take ownership
At Spring Health, we know that in order to fulfill our mission of eliminating every barrier to mental health, we must start by eliminating any barriers we encounter in our day-to-day work. When things don't go as planned, or when unexpected challenges come our way, we don't stop — we keep going. We are relentlessly resourceful, proactive, and creative, and we go beyond the call of duty. We are true owners.

(”EonLabs”), will be responsible for discovering and creating features for cryptocurrency futures contracts (i.e. BTCUSDTPERP and ETHUSDTPERP) and eventually controlling a Binance sub-account and to generate EAV (Extended Asset Value) for it with algorithmic market-timing directional trading strategies, which are either created by you or by EonLabs’ machine learning system: Enigma Trading System. In any cases, you have the freedom to choose to be employed by EonLabs or just profit share with EonLabs. What're their pros and cons? Please read https://bit.ly/3gOq02P
Compensation
We use machine learning algorithms to design market-timing directional mid-frequency algorithmic strategies to trade crypto futures contracts with our proprietary funds. Therefore, the position is highly performance-based. We feel the need to alert you that you won't be finding working for/with EonLabs rewarding unless you have pre-existing, well-defined, and proven crypto futures contract leading technical/sentiment indicator(s) or strategies to add to our mix of features or portfolio of strategies.
For experienced crypto futures contract traders
If you have proven algorithmic trading strategies and their track records (even backtesting results are acceptable),
you are eligible to connect to EonLabs’ funded Binance sub-account so that you can start profit share off of the EAV of high water mark at monthly crystallization frequency;
EonLabs will proportionately inject additional funds into the sub-account on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly) so as to raise your potential earnings; and

For those who only have novel features or ideas of features
read https://bit.ly/3gOq02P
What We Are Not!
No, we are not funded trader programs popping up all over the internet that need you to fork out a subscription or audition fee.
No, we are not here to steal your ideas because you keep all your feature rule sets and source codes to yourself. During assessment period, you do not have to share your intellectual property (i.e. ideas, logics & codes) with us until your novel feature output values are validated by our machine learning system.
No intellectual properties are exchanged until the robustness of your features' output values are validated by our machine-learning system and partnership terms (employment or profit-sharing) fully expounded and agreed by you.
Qualifications - Skills and Experience
Have either: Pre-existing, well-defined, and proven crypto futures contract leading technical or sentiment indicator(s) to add to our mix of features for time series forecasting; or existing algorithmic trading strategies that can potentially trade crypto futures contracts with certain degree of success.
Desirable: Know the meaning of: 1. funded trader programs, 2. objective functions, 3. Calmar ratio, 4. Sortino ratio, 5. risk adjusted return, 6. drawdown, 7. pine script language, 8. lagging technical indicators, 9. features in time series forecasting, 10. look-ahead bias, 11. TA-Lib; and real-money (not just some backtested, simulation or paper trading results) algorithmic trading experience and track records.
For more, read: https://bit.ly/3gOq02P
Assessment - What you have to do?
If you have existing crypto-algorithmic trading strategies, please share their simulated or historical backtesting performance analysis reports with EonLabs by contact us immediately. Otherwise, please continue with the following:
Data Reduction. Use Binance official GitHub repository (binance / binance-public-data) Python scripts (https://bit.ly/binance-scripts) to download historical OHLCV candlestick bar data of the spot market (e.g. ETHUSDT) or perpetual futures contract market (e.g. ETHUSDTPERP). On the other hand, if needed by certain novel features, download the trade (tick-by-tick) data and manipulate them into custom data representations, such as range bar data format which is demarcated by fixed interval of price instead of candlestick bar data format which is demarcated by fixed interval of time.
Features Building. Make sense of forefront time series forecasting research papers and develop novel machine learning features that are unavailable in the public domain (e.g. TA-Lib).
Evaluation. Send feature output values to EonLabs so that we can help you benchmark them against other features that we have. Note that feature output must be presented in the format of a comma delimited csv file with five (5) default columns (Date, Open, High, Low, Close) and the feature column(s). “Date” timestamp format is as follows: YYYY-MM-DD hh: mm: ss.fff (e.g. 2017-08-17 04:59:59.999)
API Implementation. If the feature values are validated by EonLabs machine learning system to have some degree of predictive power but you’d rather keep the feature rule sets and source codes to yourself, you’ll have to build a signal generation software so that our machine learning system can receive the values on a real-time basis and execute trades on your funded Binance sub-account.

〄 The Company
Eon Labs Ltd. (""EonLabs"") is a privately owned technology company that has seen rapid business expansion since its 2017 inception. There is no involvement from venture capital, and the firm relies entirely on its own resources for funding its operations. We are a digital finance and AI research firm in the blockchain space founded in the beautiful British Columbia in Canada. We develop the Enigma Trading System, which integrates with existing exchange APIs, and leverages the power of machine learning models to autonomously trade in various financial markets. The trading system is then licensed out to fund managers who use it to achieve above average gains for their investors. Fund management companies, such as Hoovest, relies on artificial intelligence-driven financial trading market analysis, trading strategies and associated custom software systems developed by EonLabs to make investment decisions, and in exchange, EonLabs receives performance-based remuneration. Among the 800+ funds listed on CryptoFundResearch, EonLabs has helped some of them stand out as some of the greatest performers in 2021, i.e. Axon.Capital. The current assets under management (AUM) exceeds $20 million in USD. EonLabs' goal is to reach $150 USD and beyond by 2023. EonLabs' Link in Bio can be found here: https://bit.ly/m/eonlabs

Application Question(s):
Do you have related studies or experience in crypto futures algorithmic trading? If yes, how skilled do you think you are on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most skilled? Tell us why you rate it so.
Have you reviewed EonLabs' company description on https://bit.ly/eonlabs ?
Have you checked out the links in the Link in Bio on https://bit.ly/m/eonlabs ?
Just a little heads-up before we go on to the next step. The area of algorithmic trading is one that is very specialized, and so are we. Even if time series forecasting might be helpful in a range of natural science research, the field of financial science is more analogous to social science, which is more of an art, despite the fact that it deals with data on a daily basis. Take into account that your participation in businesses similar to ours is the sole context in which our line of experience may be useful to you. You won't be able to take the knowledge you gain here with you to other fields of work. Are you certain that this is what you want to do?

No work is beneath any of us - from the CEO to our compliance lead - we get excited to audit our database to check each cell to ensure that they are correct and to pick up customer support calls.
We believe inventing great products happens at the intersection of extremely deep detailed domain knowledge & a very lateral thought process. We don’t like to invent for the sake of it - we do it when we think we can make something significantly better.

Block is one company built from many blocks, all united by the same purpose of economic empowerment. The blocks that form our foundational teams — People, Finance, Counsel, Hardware, Information Security, Platform Infrastructure Engineering, and more — provide support and guidance at the corporate level. They work across business groups and around the globe, spanning time zones and disciplines to develop inclusive People policies, forecast finances, give legal counsel, safeguard systems, nurture new initiatives, and more. Every challenge creates possibilities, and we need different perspectives to see them all. Bring yours to Block.

Job Description

We're building a bitcoin wallet for the next 100M bitcoin users - importantly for people around the world who likely haven't yet used bitcoin as a savings tool or for its payments capabilities yet. Our goal is economic empowerment - starting with bringing easy-to-use, reliable wallet that helps people around the world own and manage their bitcoin, rather than having to rely on several tools and services that don't work well together and are challenging to use for a wide global audience.
Our goal is to make the future of money intuitive, and safe while helping customers build a better financial future. We're assembling a team experienced in an extremely wide range of disciplines, including business, operations, design, software, hardware, security, and so many other aspects of product delivery.
We are hiring our first Product Data Scientist to help our product, marketing, engineering and customer support teams make data-driven decisions about what and how we build for our customers when helping them manage their money. This is a unique opportunity to not only be embedded with an early stage team where you'll have close proximity to strategy and building so you can produce action-oriented analyses, but you'll also influence our data infrastructure and tooling decisions.
Because you will work with bitcoin data across different sources (internal systems, blockchain, lightning network, etc.), an understanding of how these technologies function or demonstrated experience or interest working with this data is a big plus.
You will report to our Head of Business within Bitcoin Wallet. You can be based anywhere remotely in the United States, as well as in several countries around the world including the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, among other countries.
Come build the future of money with us! Learn more through our newsletter here.
You Will:
Empower our team to use data to make business decisions as we build a global product from its earliest days- an opportunity to build data analysis into the infrastructure of a team from day 1
Develop both backwards-looking analysis on product performance, marketing effectiveness, monetization and pricing and other main product and business decisions, as well as forward-looking predictive models to help us better understand customers and their needs (e.g. cluster analysis that help us map customer segments back to product usage, retention models)
Empower the teams with data and help them to make decisions on improving product features and building a meaningful roadmap (e.g. funnel metrics, analysis of churn and CS data, etc), as well as influencing important decisions like pricing based on acquisition and retention insights
As a member of the Business team, you'll have the product and business context to be able to proactively spot trends and connect sometimes seemingly disconnected data sets to help the team develop and prove out hypotheses across the end to end lifecycle, forming cohort analysis on things like acquisition channels, etc.
Navigate external data sets such as publicly available blockchain data insights (eg bitcoin blockchain analysis) to help us understand things like our total addressable market (TAM) as well as SAM and SOM
Design and help run statistically-significant experiments across different cohorts of customers and ensure hygienic approach to things like causation vs correlation
Create models that help us to analyze risk and security threats as well as optimize key decisions on our approach to money movement (i.e. transaction modeling)
Support and guide in our early data infrastructure decisions with product and engineering - as we are a zero to one team, you will get to shape the data infrastructure decisions we make so we have scalable ways of working where data is easily accessible to the right people on our team, all while ensuring that data is secure and aligned with our privacy principles and commitment to customers and partners.

Qualifications

You Have:
Background in working in product-driven organizations and building and sharing data-driven insights to help make decisions with 8+ years of experience
Experience with cohort and funnel analyses, an understanding of statistical concepts such as selection bias, probability distributions, and conditional probabilities
Experience telling stories and making relevant recommendations with data
You've set up and run A/B tests and other types of experimentation designs and can help ensure statistical significance in the right testing environment
With technical skills, you can automate complex processes and construct data pipelines
Experience with data visualization tools (e.g. Looker, PowerBI, Tableau etc.)
Work in collaborative team environments including Product, Marketing, Engineering, Design and Research
Thrives in earlier stage environments - you're a self-starter who gets excited about complex, sometimes vague, or longer-term problems and can be creative on how to solve those problems with data and insights
Familiarity or interest in learning blockchain analytics as we are building in the bitcoin space and external data sets will help you uncover richer trends and recommendations; ability to connect internal and external data sources
Technical skills: Python or R, Advanced SQL

More about Mission Lane:
Mission Lane is based in the U.S., with offices in Richmond, Virginia & San Francisco, California. Founded in December 2018, we've rapidly grown to almost 2 million customers.
It all started with a realization: nearly fifty percent of the adult population in the U.S. doesn't have access to a clear line of credit. And by ""clear"" we mean credit without crazy fees that only increase debt. Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-prime credit scores or no score at all. We decided this just wouldn't do.
We understand that everyone doesn't have the same opportunities. We also know that everyone joins us at different stages of their financial journeys. Providing access to clear credit was a critical first step, but our work isn't done. We are actively developing new products designed to meet our customers where they are, according to their needs.
We get it - life happens. That's why Mission Lane is hard at work paving a better way forward.
Just like for our customers, Mission Lane creates opportunities for our employees to learn, grow, and prosper. We strive to create an environment that brings out the best in everyone, everyday.

Speech Recognition Data Labeler (Contract),Balto,"Remote in St. Louis, MO",NaN,PostedPosted 2 days ago,$450 - $650 a week,"If you are fluent in English, responsible and detail-oriented, eligible to work in the United States, and interested in getting paid to improve and empower an…",/rc/clk?jk=5c05bbcec4ccad75&fccid=3a5f80d50b0faa42&vjs=3,"PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS A CONTRACT POSITION
Balto is a software that coaches sales and customer service agents to improve their phone calls live while they're on the phone with the customer. Powered by artificial intelligence, Balto listens to both sides of the conversation and visually prompts these agents with the best things to say, live on every call.
Pretty cool, right? But how does Balto's AI know how to help the agents? How can a software program possibly understand every situation discussed across the millions of phone calls where it is used?
That's where you come in.
In order for the AI to be able to make the best predictions and recommendations in the moment, it needs to be trained on accurate, reliable data. Our data labelers play the vital role of listening to call snippets and ensuring that the information on each call is being transcribed correctly.
Your responsibility and high attention to detail will serve you well as you quickly listen to snippets, check what you are hearing against the generated transcription, and make any necessary changes to ensure the submitted transcription correctly matches what is being said on the call.
This is a highly independent and flexible role; you are welcome to work whenever and wherever best suits you. The only requirement is that you commit at least 20 hours a week to the role.
Sounds great, how do I get paid?
Labelers are paid 80 cents for each minute of audio they transcribe. On average, it takes two seconds to label one second of audio, and your speed will only increase with experience. So the faster you can label accurately, the more money you can make. Labelers tend to make $450-$650 per week depending on their speed.
If you are fluent in English, responsible and detail-oriented, eligible to work in the United States, and interested in getting paid to improve and empower an innovative AI machine, this role might be for you!
Requirements:
Fluent in English
Minimum 20 hours commitment/week
Eligible to work in the US
Prior experience in audio transcription is preferred
Responsible & detail-oriented
INTERVIEW PROCESS:
After we receive your application, we'll review it. If there's alignment, you'll be sent a brief skills test via email asking you to label some audio segments to show you what the role will be like.
We expect the test to take 10 minutes or less.
If you pass, you'll receive a 15 min phone call from a Balto team member to tell you a bit more about the role and to answer any questions you have. if all goes well, we'll move forward with an offer which will include the completion of a background check."

Our Values
Members always come first
We serve multiple stakeholders, including providers, customers, and members. Most of the time, stakeholder priorities will be in alignment. Occasionally, we encounter difficult situations where there may need to be a tradeoff. In these situations, we prioritize members–they are the reason we exist and their wellbeing is our highest priority.
Move fast to change lives
We move quickly and intentionally to minimize suffering and do right by members. We make decisions courageously and swiftly, especially when those decisions are easily reversible. Knowing that work often fills the time allotted, we hold ourselves accountable to ambitious yet realistic timelines. We use the 80/20 rule and don't let perfect be the enemy of the good.
Science will win
Spring Health embraces science at every stage of our mission, from our beginnings with proprietary research published in a world-renowned, peer-reviewed journal to our recently published
clinical and financial ROI studies. And yet science, for us, extends beyond clinical papers–it means relying on data, evidence, and validation as much as possible, versus making assumptions. Science, for us, means truly understanding the status quo so that we can meaningfully disrupt it.
Candor with care
We believe in the power of candor to promote clarity and reduce friction, confusion, and stress. We do not refrain from speaking truth–including speaking truth to power–and we aim to do so with care and positive intent. We speak up when we don't understand or agree with each other, and deliver feedback with empathy, kindness, and genuine concern for others. Even when honesty may feel uncomfortable, we are direct and transparent–but always with care.
Embrace diverse teams and perspectives
Diversity makes us stronger. Whether its differences in background, perspective, ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality, age, or religion, we go beyond just having diverse talent—we work intentionally to support and amplify diverse voices around a table.
Take ownership
At Spring Health, we know that in order to fulfill our mission of eliminating every barrier to mental health, we must start by eliminating any barriers we encounter in our day-to-day work. When things don't go as planned, or when unexpected challenges come our way, we don't stop — we keep going. We are relentlessly resourceful, proactive, and creative, and we go beyond the call of duty. We are true owners.

Over the next year, we'll grow quickly to bring better care to many more members and their communities. To do this, we need people who, like us, believe that everyone should have good care for what matters to them, in their community.
Our work is grounded in a belief in the power of a diverse community.

Ledger Investing is a Y Combinator backed insure-tech startup that is transforming the way insurance risks are financed. Today, Ledger is an online marketplace connecting insurance risk to capital, focusing on securitization. Insurance risk originators are able to source capital more efficiently vs. the traditional value-chain. Capital providers gain access to an asset class that is highly diversified vs. most asset classes. Insurance securitization has quickly grown to be a $100 billion market but is limited in scope due to opacity and complexity. Ledger is expanding this market to $1 trillion by building a seamless data pipeline from the policyholder to the capital markets, enabling transparency, and bringing best-in-class analytics and real-time insights to the table. Our recent $75 million Series B round of investment funding has set us up for exponential growth. We are on our way to disrupting the industry by serving as an unparalleled, advantageous marketplace for virtually all types of insurance risks and capital, including traditional reinsurers, institutional investors, and accredited investors.
About the Team:
Data scientists at Ledger are critical to the success of the company. Our team specializes in modeling the behavior of casualty insurance risk portfolios. We analyze and predict the performance of every insurance program that seeks capital through us, and our analyses are critical in determining on what terms, if any, our investors are willing to offer capital for each program. In short, our math forms the ground truth that serves as the basis of negotiations for transactions with tens of millions of dollars at stake.
About the Position:
As our company continues to grow, we are focused on opportunities to use technology to scale efficiently. From a data science perspective, one such core opportunity is providing a seamless infrastructure layer that allows everyone in the organization to easily train, backtest, and deploy statistical models. We heavily rely on Stan for our modeling, which has not gotten as much attention as some other tools in the data science and machine learning communities for this sort of infrastructure.
A complete analytical process for a single insurance program may consist of a half a dozen or more independent statistical models. The identity, configuration and method of combination of these models varies considerably from program to program, and we are responsible for providing daily or weekly performance updates on dozens of these programs. Striking the right balance between flexibility and consistency for deploying these analytical processes to production is another key problem.
If these problems sound fun and interesting, we'd love to have you on our team.
About You:
Successful candidates will have all of the following attributes:
Strong knowledge of statistics, machine learning, and data science.
Extensive experience with Python and its associated ecosystem for machine learning (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Jupyter, etc).
Extensive experience with virtualization, cloud environments, cluster computing, and other techniques for efficiently deploying models for large-scale production use.
Experience with relational databases and strong ability to write queries in SQL.
Familiarity with version control, especially Git/GitHub.
Ability to work independently and communicate ideas effectively.
The following attributes will help you stand out from the crowd:
A track record of building or contributing to open-source projects.
Working knowledge of property & casualty insurance, particularly from an actuarial and/or underwriting perspective.
Experience with Stan or another open-source tool for estimating Bayesian models via HMC.

We're taking the best parts of in-person team collaboration, and making them even better in the remote-first world. We're starting by building a unique real-time collaboration layer for remote sales teams. On our virtual sales floor, sales representatives can work together while prospecting, emailing and calling customers.
Teams like Gong, Modern Health, and Robin are using Nooks to recreate the in-office experience during daily co-working sessions.
It's helped them:
on average, book 60% more meetings
retain 30% more reps AND managers
reach activity numbers to hit quota
The pandemic made sales lonely. Help us make it a team sport again!
Why ML?
Sales reps spend their day scouting for prospects & making hundreds of personalized emails, videos and cold calls. Nooks tries to inject collaboration into their workday — but only when it matters.
We want reps to listen to each other's cold calls — but only when they're talking to a qualified client, not when they're hitting an answering machine or dial tree for the 20th time.
We want reps to collaborate on the high-level talking points they use in emails — but without having to review every single email their colleagues send out.
That's where the Nooks Data Engine comes into play. We use speech recognition, NLP, and active learning to intelligently surface portions of calls and emails that others should pay attention to. Most importantly, we do this real-time, making collaboration and learning effortless.
Role Responsibilities
As part of the team, you will be working with an exceptional group of skilled software engineers and ML / data scientists. You will own problems end-to-end, and use your knowledge and creativity to solve them using data. The code you write will impact remote sales teams and enable them to work faster and more efficiently.
You'll also contribute to brainstorming sessions on ML projects, and work with the Product team to shape Nooks's future features and product roadmap.
Requirements
Deep subject matter expertise in machine learning, especially in NLP and speech recognition
2+ years of experience working with data at scale or deploying ML models in production environments
Good communication skills, including an ability to articulately convey the benefits and drawbacks of various approaches
Experience with deep learning frameworks: Pytorch or Tensorflow
Ability to articulate design and implementation details to find the best solution
Ability to iterate quickly on ideas
Focus on delivering results in an environment with important deadlines and multiple priorities
Bonus if you have ...
Previously published research papers in machine learning or artificial intelligence
Set up cloud infrastructure for data pipelines or production models in AWS, GCP, or Azure
A GitHub profile or personal website showcasing previous projects and experiences

In a perfect world, every lease would end with zero balance. Properties and tenants could go their separate ways without squabbling over outstanding debts and deposits. Those debts and deposits make up hundreds of millions of dollars each year and most of it is just forfeited— languishing in escrow, sent to collections, or simply written off as bad debt.
At LeaseLock, we believe in a better way. We’re empowering the built world with better technology and equipping property owners and operators with a new generation of financial tools to reduce risk, recapture revenue, and optimize asset performance. Our financial technology creates more valuable, efficient properties by turning unpredictable loss and damage into dependable operating income, getting each lease closer to zero balance.
Powered by our data platform and AI risk engine, LeaseLock develops solutions, like our flagship lease insurance, that are driving the future of residential rental real estate. Launched in 2016 and growing rapidly, we’ve insured over $3 billion in leases with clients representing the top property management companies and ownership groups in the country.
ROLE SUMMARY:
LeaseLock processes large-scale, complex datasets to automate the deployment of insurance across our clients’ assets. As a Senior Data Analyst, you will take ownership over our data quality and integrity layer, which is the heartbeat of our business. You’ll leverage your creative, analytical, and technical skills to ensure high-quality, auditable reporting for our financial stakeholders and a seamless product experience for our customers. Communication is key: you’ll present analysis to stakeholders across the company and empower executive-level decision making. The ideal candidate will enjoy solving these challenging problems that help unlock our next phase of growth.

Analyze financial data to ensure we meet the SLAs of our financial stakeholders (e.g. insurance carriers, investors).
Perform root cause analysis and work with engineering to resolve bugs impacting our data integrity.
Create documentation to ensure high-visibility and continuous improvement around data quality.
Utilize internal reporting platforms, such as Looker, to create and monitor taxonomies for data quality improvement efforts. Create derived data sets that can be efficiently monitored and shared. These data reports and dashboards are vital to the on-going health of the business
Build incisive reports in Looker to track and proactively surface problems in our data quality.
Work with Sr. Data Analyst, Product and Engineering to design a roadmap for our data quality and understanding layer.

*
QUALIFICATIONS: *
3-5 years experience in a Data Analyst role
Strong SQL Skills — You might fancy yourself a SQL jockey and know your way around a database. You’re no stranger to joins and case statements; have used leads, lags, and array_aggs. You understand that sometimes the answer can only be found in the data
Looker Experience is a plus — You believe a tool like Looker is a great tool for automating your reporting and findings. You understand the concept of a model, view, and love writing LookML. You might not be the one running the show, but you can understand and update an existing report in Looker.
Spreadsheets — You’re no stranger to a VLOOKUP() and know your way around Conditional Formatting. You’ve written spreadsheet functions in Google Sheets or Excel and feel comfortable using IF statements to highlight and call out potential issues.
Data Presentation — You understand that data in a raw format is not digestible for everyone. You’re able to present and summarize data findings in a meaningful way that fits your audience. You know how to use visualization to tell a story.
Data Pattern Analysis — Patterns are your bread and butter. You can look at a set of data and as you go through it start to taxonomize different patterns in your head. Therefore, the next time you come across a similar problem, you’re already ready to solve it not just for the problem at hand but across the board.
Data-Driven Mindset — You think in SELECT statements, just kidding. When thinking through a problem, you want to see what the data tells you before jumping to any conclusions. You also recognize that data can be error prone, but is still the truth of our system. When asked a question, you answer with both qualitative and quantitative details.
Problem Solver — In this role, the devil really is in the details. You’re the kind of person who is eager to dive into data. You exist to solve problems, you understand the value of the scientific method, and you know how to connect the dots to come to an understanding
Love for Documentation — Searching for the problem is only half the fun! You’re quick to write up your findings and share them with the broader organization to help prevent issues from being a common occurrence
*
NICE TO HAVE: *
Financial Data Experience — You’ve worked with financial data and aren’t afraid of the concept of a ledger. The financial data impacts when resolving data mismatches are always in the back of your head. You are comfortable comparing the differences between what was and would be with a change.
Python (or similar) — You don’t need to be a level 10 master, but you’re not afraid to jump in either. You’ve successfully automated your data work with a Python script (or similar)
Excel — You know Excel better than I can explain it. You’ve used all the standard functions and can make sense of all the different tabs. You’re quick to share tips and can pivot and graph data in a way that’s ready for anyone’s needs
*
COMMON QUESTIONS*
Will this position have direct reports?
No this is an individual contributor position
Where does this role report?
This role reports into a Manager within our Data team.
Where is this role located?
We are a remote first organization, so we are fine with anyone located within the United States working remotely from their current residence.
Do you accept applicants on a Work Visa?
We are happy to accept applicants who currently hold a valid work visa that has at least 3+ years of work authorization left.

"Consultancy – Natural Language Processing (NLP) Researcher, Accelerator Lab Network",United Nations Development Programme (HQ),Remote,NaN,PostedPosted 6 days ago,NaN,"Ability to meet deadlines, work under pressure, manage workflows, and operate as part of a distributed team with members across almost every time-zone on the…",/rc/clk?jk=188c37717839db30&fccid=f91d139cd7318641&vjs=3,"Background
The UNDP Accelerator Labs Network is the largest learning network in the world. It includes 91 public innovation labs and a global curation team, all embedded within UNDP’s global architecture and country platforms.
Each lab surfaces and reinforces locally sourced solutions to development challenges, and mobilizes a wide and dynamic range of partners who contribute knowledge, resources, and experience. The goal is to transform traditional development approaches by introducing new protocols, backed by evidence and practice, to accelerate the testing and dissemination of solutions within, and across countries, while at the same time enabling the global community to collectively learn from local knowledge and ingenuity at a speed and scale that our societies and planet require.
To support these learning outcomes, the UNDP Accelerator Labs global team is building a Network Learning Strategy and Prototype for knowledge management. The strategy has a strong digital component, that builds on the idea of “going where the information is”. The goal is to facilitate the detection of “where” knowledge is held in the network, and “why” it can be assumed to be held there, rather than trying to capture, infer, or extrapolate precisely “what” that knowledge is. This requires “listening” to the activities of the network, by centralizing and making sense of the content the labs put out, as well as the digital traces they leave behind as they conduct their work.
The Network Learning Prototype pulls together these unstructured data mainly text from various sources, including conversations on WhatsApp and Teams, blogs published on UNDP Country Office websites and Medium, and internal reporting feeds. While it is hardly big data, the volume is reaching a point where automation is becoming necessary to detect latent topics and trends that emerge from the network, and to structure and map open-ended taxonomies. The NLP researcher will work on this directly with the Lead Data Scientist of the UNDP Accelerator Labs global team.
The purpose of this procurement exercise is to contract an individual consultant who will work with the lead Data Scientist of the UNDP Accelerators Labs global team on a novel knowledge management pipeline that pulls together unstructured data (mainly text) from various sources including conversations on WhatsApp and Teams, blogs published on UNDP Country Office websites and Medium, and internal reporting feeds and computationally looks for latent topics and trends that emerge from the work being conducted across the network of Accelerator Labs. The main objective of the consultancy will be to improve the topic modeling component of the pipeline.

Duties and Responsibilities
OF WORK, RESPONSIBILITIES AND DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ANALYTICAL WORK
Explore word and sequence embedding techniques to improve an early prototype for structuring open-ended, multi-language taxonomies.
Design, build, and evaluate topic models and more recent BERT-based zero-shot classifiers in Python for the Network Learning Prototype—primarily in English, but ideally also in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic.
Collaborate with different teams across UNDP to build a corpus of sustainable development-related documents, presumably in multiple languages, and fine-tune language models using this corpus.
Work with the Lead Data Scientist and the Full Stack Developer to take useful models and classifiers to production and integrate them into a suite of UNDP Accelerator Labs online tools and platforms.
Conduct occasional text analyses for the Accelerator Labs Network global team.
Document the work produced.

Role.
The focus of the Data Architect will be required to work across a wide variety of stakeholders. The breadth will include gathering strategic level data to support Core Services Capability Development through data exploitation (including understanding legacy data architectures), sourcing artefacts, gap analysis, and archiving/curating of data. The focus of the Data Architect will be external (or 'up and out') to the immediate programming or Capability Development environment. Depth will range from the working level at ACT and down to subordinate levels within the NATO Command Structure (NCS) to gather data. Importantly, interaction and data gathering will also be required with NATO Agencies and NATO Headquarters bodies such as the C3 Staff, Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), NATO Office of Resources (NOR) and relevant standards bodies. It will involve working closely with entities involved in the NATO Cyber Adaptation Programme. Most significantly, this will involve working with data modellers and data scientists within ACT as part of NATO's wider Data Exploitation Framework and Data Exploitation Programme implementation effort.
This work will be critical to the broader effort to implement NATO's Digital Transformation strategy.
Principal Duties.
Core Services are foundational and provides the 'platform' for many capabilities. It must be coherent with high-level concepts, initiatives and regulations to name some external drivers. The advent of NATO's Digital Backbone and Digital Transformation ambition makes the need for data rationalisation, robust data gathering, analysis and management greater than ever. Much of this work will emerge from the strategic level. Core Services requires dedicated data architecture capacity to address aspects of the external environment given the complex nature of its services particularly with the possibility of public cloud prevision. The Q62 Data Architect will work within the CAP CIS Core Services team reporting to the CS Programme Director (who will also act as Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR)). In functional terms, the contractor will work closely with ACT's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Section taking guidance and joining data forums and activities as necessary. This support is required to ensure that a solid base of specialist and corporate knowledge is available covering the extensive processes and procedures within the CS area.

Partial or fully remote work is available following https://orise.orau.gov/usda-ars/documents/orise-virtual-remote-mentor-guide.pdf
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is one of the major operation components of the Department of Health and Human Services. CDC works to protect America from health, safety and security threats, both foreign and in the U.S. Whether diseases start at home or abroad, are chronic or acute, curable or preventable, human error or deliberate attack, CDC fights disease and supports communities and citizens to do the same.
BSPB serves as a national reference laboratory for several high consequence bacterial pathogens, including Bacillus anthracis, Burkholderia mallei and pseudomallei, Brucella spp., as well as over 500 rare and unusual bacterial pathogens. A major component of the work done within BSPB is developing and maintaining bioinformatic tools to assist BSPB and its partners (both national and international) to investigate outbreaks, conduct surveillance, and identify novel species of bacterial pathogens.
Research Project: BSPB is looking for a candidate to participate in data management, bioinformatic pipeline development, analysis and visualization projects related to genomic and metagenomic data for bacterial pathogens. The fellow will conduct research on containerizing specialized bioinformatic pipelines, currently in use within the branch, so that standardized bioinformatic tools may be deployed to partner labs unable to perform their own genomic analysis. This will increase both national and international capacity and ensure that genomic analysis is being performed in a consistent and reproducible manner between multiple laboratories. The fellow will also collaborate with MicrobeNet, a free online virtual reference laboratory run within BSPB, to create an organized state and national surveillance network of diseases which are not currently captured by active systems.

How We Work
Freedom and Flexibility: At Loom, we believe work is an act, not a place. When we disengage work from a location, we can accommodate a broad range of life choices. You can choose to work from home or while you travel. We are able to hire across the United States and are continuing to expand our international presence. And you are free to move within a country without any adjustment to compensation.
Engaging Workday: The key to an engaging workday is finding the right balance between different ways to work sync, async, text and video. Loom makes it easier for us to say what we mean without having to schedule a zoom meeting or struggle to find the right words. And using async communication allows us to free up time for deep work every day. We believe there's a place for sync time - often a conversation on Zoom is exactly what is needed. For team meetings, this 'sync time' is typically between 9AM-Noon PT given where the overlap of timezones where Loommates are located.
Work-Rest Balance: The way we balance the fast-paced demands of a high-growth startup and sustainability is making rest a priority. We offer a flexible PTO policy so you're able to take time off when you need it. We also go fully offline for Summer Break around 4th of July and between Christmas and New Years. Rest is also part of the workday, not just during PTO. Taking a break for personal commitments, whether it's watching the kids or getting some exercise is a natural part of the workday.
Social Connection: Relationships and connectedness matter. We are intentional about building trust and relationships through unique, shared experiences. Our virtual workspace keeps us connected day-to-day whether it's through Looms celebrating wins or our buzzing Slack communities. Loommates are able to meet in person with their teams at least twice a year purely for fun. We have also built local offices for those who want to work or meet in person, starting with San Francisco and New York City.

RAND's Summer Associate Program introduces outstanding graduate students in aerospace/aeronautical, electrical or mechanical engineering, computer or information science, applied mathematics, data science, physics or other related STEM fields to the RAND Corporation, an institution that conducts research on a wide range of domestic and international social policy issues as well as national security problems. RAND employs about 100 engineers, computer/information scientists, physicists, and applied mathematicians in Santa Monica, CA, Washington, D.C., and Pittsburgh, PA.
Please note: Our summer 2023 program will be a hybrid model including in person work at one of RAND’s four offices with remote flexibility or working fully remote from where you live. In person positions are typically available in RAND's major U.S. offices—Santa Monica, CA; Washington, DC; Pittsburgh, PA; and Boston, MA. Office placement decisions depend on the availability of in-person mentorship. For the 2023 Summer Program, students must reside in the U.S. throughout their RAND summer assignment. International students who are planning to live in the U.S. during the summer of 2023 are eligible to apply. Any applicant who does not plan to live in the United States during the summer is not eligible for hire in the 2023 cycle.
Summer Associates experience the following at RAND:
Typically work at RAND for a 12-week period during the summer;
Receive a bi-weekly paycheck during their assignment with RAND;
Conduct research that can be completed during their time at RAND and present the results of this research to the RAND community via a 15-30 minute briefing at the end of their three-month assignment;
Are closely mentored by one to two established RAND researchers;
Are highly encouraged to network and interact with other researchers outside of their primary mentorship team and area of expertise;
Are invited to attend a number of seminars from researchers both within and outside of RAND.
Qualifications
The position is designed for full-time masters or doctoral students in aerospace/aeronautical, electrical or mechanical engineering, computer or information science, applied mathematics, data science, physics, or other related STEM fields. In order to qualify for the program, students must graduate on or after December 2023.
A keen interest in working on applied, policy-oriented research questions is necessary. Applicants are strongly encouraged to explore RAND's website (
www.rand.org
) for details on RAND's ongoing research portfolio. Unfortunately, we do not know in advance which projects may require Summer Associates.
Additional qualifications required:
Excellent analytic skills;
Proven ability in quantitative and/or qualitative research methods;
Ability to communicate clearly and effectively in English, both verbally and in writing;
Ability to work effectively as a member of a multidisciplinary team;
Strong commitment to RAND's core values of quality and objectivity;
Proof of legal right to work in the United States is required upon hire;
U.S. Citizenship is not necessary except when required for certain types of project work (e.g., the project contract requires it or the project work itself requires a security clearance)
Residency in the U.S. (excluding U.S. territories) is required
Who is not eligible?
The program does not hire high school students, undergraduates, or postdoctoral fellows at this time. Graduate students who will graduate prior to the summer of employment are not eligible. The program typically does not consider master's degree students except in the Engineering, Computer or Information Science, and Operations Research disciplines.
